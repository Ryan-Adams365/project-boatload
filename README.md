# project-boatload

## **Please note: This project was built to be implemented in Google Cloud Platform. However, I am no longer paying the platform fee and I have not set up the server anywhere else, so the Postman test suite will not function.

### This is a student project for my cloud computing class. It is a web API that handles requests for boats and loads on those boats. In the docs folder you can find a comprehensive API spec along with a Postman testing suite.
